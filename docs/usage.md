# How to Use Pagetual

Welcome! Now that you've got Pagetual installed, let's take a quick tour of what it can do. Don't worry, it's designed to be simple and work automatically for most sites.

## The Basics: Just Scroll!

For most websites, you don't have to do anything at all. Just visit a site with multiple pages, like [a search on Bing](https://bing.com/search?q=pagetual), and scroll to the bottom. You'll see Pagetual automatically load the next page for you. Easy, right?

## The Page Divider

As you scroll, you'll see a small bar appear between pages. This is the Page Divider, and it's more than just a separator.

*   **☯️ (Tai Chi Icon):** Click this to instantly jump back to the top of the page.
*   **"Page X":** This shows you which page you're on. You can even click the number to jump to a specific page!
*   **🔽 (Target Icon):** Click this to zip right down to the very bottom.
*   **Want to stop auto-loading?** Just click anywhere on the divider bar.

**Pro Tip:** You can hide the divider entirely in the settings for a seamless, immersive experience.

## The Command Menu

Need to make a quick change? Click your script manager's icon (like Tampermonkey) in your browser's toolbar, and you'll see a menu for Pagetual.

*   **Configure:** This is your control center! It takes you to the main settings page where you can customize everything.
*   **Disable on this site:** Temporarily turn off Pagetual for the website you're currently on.
*   **Force Join:** Is a site not working correctly? This is your secret weapon. It forces the next page to load, which can fix stubborn or oddly-coded websites.
*   **Update online rules:** This manually checks for updates to any community rule lists you've subscribed to.

## Making It Your Own: Key Settings

On the **Configure** page, you can tweak Pagetual to work exactly how you want.

*   **Write History:** Turn this on to save your spot. When you leave a page and come back, you'll return to where you left off in the scroll.
*   **Open in New Tab:** Force all links from loaded pages to open in a new tab.
*   **Pre-load Next Page:** For an extra speed boost, Pagetual can start loading the next page's images and content before you even get there.

## For Power Users: Custom Rules

While Pagetual's automatic mode is great, sometimes you need more control. Custom rules let you tell Pagetual *exactly* how to handle a specific site.

This is an advanced feature, but we've made it as easy as possible with a **visual selector tool**. Just click the element on the page you want to grab, and Pagetual will generate the code for you.
