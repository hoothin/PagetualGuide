Instead of relying on a rigid set of rules, it analyzes pages on the fly. This smart approach means:</p><ul><li><strong>It works on most sites automatically.</strong> No need to find and install rules.</li><li><strong>It doesn&#39;t break easily.</strong> When a site changes, Pagetual usually adapts without you needing to do a thing.</li><li><strong>It respects your time.</strong> You get a seamless, never-ending scroll without the constant maintenance.</li></ul><p>So if you&#39;re looking for an infinite scrolling tool that outshines the rest, the answer isn&#39;t more complexity.
