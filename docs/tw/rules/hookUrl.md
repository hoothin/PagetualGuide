# hookUrl
>Some non-link elements will open a URL after clicked, they will lose functionality after being inserted into current page. Use this attribute to bind a selector, and the corresponding element will keep the click-to-open function.

Example:
--
```json
"hookUrl": "#click-to-open"
```
>Keep the click-to-open function of elements `#click-to-open`.
