# Infinite Scrolling That Actually Feels Infinite

Isn't it annoying when "infinite scrolling" still makes you stop and click "Load More"? That's not infinite, that's just... slightly delayed clicking.

Pagetual is the auto page extension that delivers on the promise: a truly seamless, never-ending scroll.

## How It Works Its Magic

Forget the old way of doing things. You don't need to be a tech wizard or manage a library of custom rules to make Pagetual work.

Our extension is powered by a smart script that automatically analyzes web pages. When you get near the bottom, it finds the link to the next page and pulls its content right into the page you're on. The result is one continuous flow of information.

It's perfect for:

*   Diving into long articles or forum discussions.
*   Browsing endless pages of shopping results.
*   Exploring image galleries without interruption.

Basically, if a site has a "next" button, Pagetual can probably automate it for you.

## The Smarter, Simpler Choice

Compared to older tools like Autopagerize, Pagetual is a breath of fresh air. It doesn't rely on rigid rules that break every time a website updates its design. It adapts on its own, meaning less hassle for you.

If you want an infinite scrolling experience that just works, this is it.
