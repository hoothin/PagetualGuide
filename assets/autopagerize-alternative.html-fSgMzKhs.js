While old tools rely on rigid, pre-made rules for every single website, Pagetual uses its brain.</p><p>It intelligently analyzes the page you&#39;re on and <strong>figures out for itself</strong> where the &quot;next page&quot; link is. This means:</p><ul><li><strong>It Works Almost Everywhere:</strong> Seriously. About 90% of websites will work right away, no questions asked.</li><li><strong>It Survives Website Redesigns:</strong> When a site changes its look, older pagers break. Pagetual just adapts.</li><li><strong>You Can (Mostly) Forget About Rules:</strong> The real beauty is that you don&#39;t have to spend your life managing a giant list of rules. It just works.</li></ul><p>So, if you loved the <em>idea</em> of Autopagerize but hated the upkeep, Pagetual is the upgrade you&#39;ve been waiting for.</p><p>It gives you that glorious, uninterrupted, never-ending scroll you want, without any of the headaches.</p><p>Ready to browse smarter, not harder?</p><h2 id="installation-environment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#installation-environment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Installation Environment</h2><p>Supports browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera and Safari, as well as Android / iOS platforms.</p><h2 id="statistical-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#statistical-data" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Statistical data</h2><ul><li>Downloaded over 320,000 times online.</li><li>User rating is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐97.6 out of 100.</li></ul>',12),_=e("strong",null,"Get ☯️Pagetual now →",-1);function w(v,y){const t=n("RouterLink");return s(),l("div",null,[g,p,c,e("p",null,[a(t,{to:"/setup.html"},{default:o(()=>[f]),_:1})]),m,e("p",null,[a(t,{to:"/setup.html"},{default:o(()=>[_]),_:1})])])}const x=r(d,[["render",w],["__file","autopagerize-alternative.html.vue"]]);export{x as default};
