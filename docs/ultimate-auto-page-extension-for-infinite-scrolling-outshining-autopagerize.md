# The Ultimate Auto Pager? The One That Actually Works.

Let's be honest. The "ultimate" infinite scrolling extension isn't the one with the most features you'll never use. It's the one you install once and then forget it's even there—because it just works.

That's Pagetual.

## Stop Babysitting Your Browser Extensions

We've all been there. You install an auto pager, and it's great... until the first website redesigns its layout. Then it breaks. You have to go hunting for new rules, edit selectors, and waste time just to get back to browsing.

Pagetual was built to end that cycle.

Its standout feature is its intelligence. Instead of relying on a rigid set of rules, it analyzes pages on the fly. This smart approach means:

*   **It works on most sites automatically.** No need to find and install rules.
*   **It doesn't break easily.** When a site changes, Pagetual usually adapts without you needing to do a thing.
*   **It respects your time.** You get a seamless, never-ending scroll without the constant maintenance.

So if you're looking for an infinite scrolling tool that outshines the rest, the answer isn't more complexity. It's more intelligence.
